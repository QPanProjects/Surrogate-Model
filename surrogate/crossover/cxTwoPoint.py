"""Executes a two-point crossover on the input :term:`sequence`
individuals. The two individuals are modified in place and both keep
their original length.

:param ind1: The first individual participating in the crossover.
:param ind2: The second individual participating in the crossover.
:returns: A tuple of two individuals.

This function uses the :func:`~random.randint` function from the Python
base :mod:`random` module.
